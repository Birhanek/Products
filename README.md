## Getting with our project
```
The project main motive is to know how CRUD operations did in react with the knowledge we have learned sofar.
```
## what does it do the system
```
We have an api that hosts the data that is going to feed our frontend.

Create - creating new product
Read - getting all data from the api
Update - updating a specific data using an id
Delete - deleting a data with an id
```
## What we have used in building the system
```
useState() - to contain the state of a specific variable and for updating the specific state. Eg. const [productTitle,setProductTitle] = useSate('');
useEffect() - we have used this hook when we read the data and during updating of a data
useNavigate()- used to navigate to the specified URL

Routing is fully implemented :
    - creating a product 
    - Updating a product

```
## Where does the data come?
```
We have used a localhost database generator (that looks like an API)
db.json - is an api that stores data.
